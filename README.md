# Advanced-Reaction-Verification-System

Simple and easy to use. After the bot is started simply send any
message to the discord and once it is reacted with the specified
role the member will get a message via Dm. This message just 
explains why they have to verify before accessing any channels
in the discord and how to get the specified role to be verified.
All they have to do is react to the message in Dm and they get 
the role. (the reaction will only work on messages sent after
the bot is started, keep this in mind!)

How to make it work with your discord!
Change action #3: Only do this if you wanna change the 
emoji they have to react with (Note, they will get the
dm if they react to any message with this emote.)

Chage action #4 & 5: Do this to change the message they recieve
via DM.

Change action #9: Change the "Role ID" to the role you want the members
to get when verifying. You can find this by right clicking on the role
and clicking "Copy ID"

Change action 12 & 13: Only change these if you want the success and error
message to be changed. *NOTE*: MEMBERS ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES TO REACT TO THE
MESSAGE VIA DM, IF THEY DONT THEY WILL GET AN ERROR MESSAGE!
